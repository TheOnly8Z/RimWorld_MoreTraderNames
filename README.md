## Description
Tired of Ludeon Lubricants selling guns? Spice up those orbital traders with appropriate names.

With this mod, orbital traders get a new set of naming schemes that are both more varied, and better related to their ship type.

Combat supplier will get names like "Arsenal" and "Arms", exotic traders get names like "Trinkets" and "Oddities", and slave ships get names like "Gang" and "Smugglers".

There are also more a lot more possibilities in terms of name generation, making every trader that much more unique (and potentially hilarious).
